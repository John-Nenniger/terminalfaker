Terminal Faker
===========

An extensible pseudo-terminal in Javascript.

# What's this?
Terminal Faker is a Javascript, Linux-like terminal simulation for use in the browser. Originally forked from [AVGP/terminal.js](https://github.com/AVGP/terminal.js).

There is a [live demo here](https://syntaxseed.github.io/terminalfaker/).

You can do a bunch of things with it:

- Create a CLI-style API interface that runs in the browser.
- Create a remote terminal emulator for something that exposes an interface in a browser-consumable way (CORS, Websocket, WebRTC, ...).
- Create a text-based adventure game in the browser.
- Whatever you can come up with, where a command line interface is useful.

## How do I use it?
It's really easy:

1. You include the ``terminal.css`` and ``terminal.js`` files and have a container element (e.g. a div) with a child element holding a contenteditable element of class ``input`` and another span of class ``prompt`` with the actual prompt line you want to display.
2. You create an object with methods that will be your commands (see below for the details of how this works).
3. Call terminal.init and pass the container element, your commands object, and a callback which creates the custom prompt. - **Ready to roll!**

Here's a minimal example:

```html
  <div id="terminal">
    <p>Type 'help' to get started.</p>
    <p class="hidden">
      <p id="intro">Type 'help' to get started.</p>
      <span class="prompt"></span>
      <span contenteditable="true" class="input"> </span>
    </p>
  </div>
  <script src="js/terminal.js"></script>
  <script>
    var version = '1.0.0'; // Used in various commands.
    var commands = {};
    commands.cow = {
          about:  "What does the cow say?",
          exe:  function() {
            return "Moooooo!";
          }
    };

    // Set the command prompt style:
    var customPrompt = function () { return "<span style='color:#00ffff;'>user@terminal.js $</span> ";};

    // Initialize the terminal:
    var term = Terminal.init(document.getElementById("terminal"), commands, customPrompt);
  </script>
```

## Extensible command interface

The terminal is only a way to interact with "commands" and "commands" are a bundles of functionality.
So to use the terminal, you'll need to create a bunch of functions that actually do something - and that's not hard.

First we modify our minimal example to load in the built-in commands and then extend them with custom commands defined in commands.js:

```html
  ...
  <script src="js/terminal.js"></script>
  <script src="js/system.js"></script>
  <script src="commands.js"></script>
  <script>
      // Extend the built-in system commands with the custom commands from commands.js.
      var commands = extendObject(builtInCommands, customCommands);
  ...
```

Then, in commands.js we will define custom commands (there are a couple examples in there already for you).

### A greeting command
So let's build a command that greets the user with the name she enters, like this:

```bash
$ hello Alice
Hi there, Alice
```

In commands.js this is done by creating a ``customCommands`` object and adding a "hello" object to it with an "about" property and a "exe" property.

''customCommands.hello.about'' will contain a string of the help info to display if the user types ``help hello``.

''customCommands.hello.exe'' will contain the closure to execute when the command is run. It can receive an "args" parameter which is an array of the command line arguments.

In this case, hello will take one parameter, which will be the array of arguments (separated by spaces) entered to call the command and returns HTML to be displayed in the terminal.

```javascript
var customCommands = {};
customCommands.hello = {
    about: "hello [arg ...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greet the user with a message.",
    exe: function (args) {                          // Executed for this command. args[0] contains the command name.
        if (args.length < 2) {
            return "Hello. Why don't you tell me your name?";
        }
        var name = "";
        // Concatenate all remaining arguments as the 'name'.
        for (var i = 1; i < args.length; i++) {
            name += args[i] + " ";
        }
        return "Hello " + name.trim();
    }
};
```

Note that the ``args`` array's first element is the name of the command itself.

That's it! Now the commands defined in commands.js will extend (and overwrite if re-defined) the built-in commands. We have a terminal that can greet the user :)
